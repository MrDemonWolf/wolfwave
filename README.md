<!-- ![WolfWave Banner](banner.jpg) -->

WolfWave is a professional-grade macOS menu bar utility that bridges Apple Music with the platforms you use. Effortlessly broadcast real-time song data to stream overlays via WebSockets, interact with your Twitch community through automated chat commands, and show what you're listening to on Discord.

## Features

- **Real-time Now Playing** — Track Apple Music and broadcast instantly via ScriptingBridge
- **Twitch Chat Bot** — `!song`, `!currentsong`, `!nowplaying`, `!lastsong` via EventSub + Helix
- **Discord Rich Presence** — Show "Listening to Apple Music" on your Discord profile with dynamic album art
- **WebSocket Streaming** — Send now-playing data to overlays (ws:// or wss://)
- **Secure by Default** — All credentials stored in macOS Keychain; no plain-text tokens
- **First-Launch Onboarding** — Guided setup wizard for new users

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest DMG from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MrDemonWolf/WolfWave/releases) page
2. Open the DMG and drag **WolfWave** to your **Applications** folder
3. Launch WolfWave and follow the onboarding wizard

> The app is signed and notarized by Apple — no Gatekeeper warnings.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

See [Releasing & Notarization](/docs/content/docs/getting-started.mdx) in the docs for full CI/CD setup instructions.

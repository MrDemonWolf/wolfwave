# WolfWave - Apple Music + Twitch Companion 🎵

![WolfWave Banner](banner.jpg)

Your Stream's Now Playing Companion! WolfWave makes it easy to share what you're listening to with your community. Show real-time "now playing" info, let your chat ask for the current song, and keep everything secure and lightweight.

Whether you're streaming, recording, or just vibing, WolfWave helps your audience connect with your music. Keep things simple, fast, and privacy-friendly.

Start your stream with a song, or let your chat discover new music with `!song`. Let's make sharing your soundtrack effortless!

## Features

- **Real-time Now Playing**: Tracks the current Apple Music song and updates instantly using ScriptingBridge.
- **Twitch Chat Integration**: Responds to `!song`, `!currentsong`, and `!nowplaying` using modern EventSub + Helix (no IRC).
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Broadcast now-playing data to your overlay or tools (ws:// or wss://).
- **Secure by Default**: All credentials stored in macOS Keychain; no plain-text tokens.
- **Professional Codebase**: Comprehensive documentation, MARK sections, and clean architecture throughout.

**Architecture Highlights:**

- **MARK Sections**: Every file uses clear section markers (Properties, Public Methods, Private Helpers, etc.)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive DocC-style comments with parameter/return documentation
- **Delegation Pattern**: `MusicPlaybackMonitorDelegate` for track updates
- **MVVM**: ViewModels separate UI logic from business logic
- **Async/Await**: Modern Swift concurrency throughout

### Twitch Chat Bot

The bot is implemented with `TwitchChatService` using Twitch Helix + EventSub (no IRC).

**Features:**

- **EventSub WebSocket**: Real-time chat message notifications
- **OAuth Device Code Flow**: Secure authentication via `TwitchDeviceAuth`
- **Token Validation**: Automatic token validation on app launch
- **Command System**: Extensible bot command architecture

**Usage:**

- Connect with saved credentials: `joinChannel(broadcasterID:botID:token:clientID:)` or `connectToChannel(channelName:token:clientID:)`.
- Send chat messages via Helix: `sendMessage(_:)` or `sendMessage(_:replyTo:)`.
- Supply current track info for commands: set `getCurrentSongInfo` on the service.
- Commands can be toggled in Settings ("Bot Commands" → "Current Song").
- The service respects `commandsEnabled` so you can disable all commands from Settings.

**Documentation:**

- Comprehensive MARK sections organize the 700+ line service file
- DocC-style comments document all public methods
- Typed errors with localized descriptions (`ConnectionError`)
- Models for chat messages, badges, and replies

### Bot Command Architecture

Commands live under `Services/Twitch/Commands` with a clean, extensible design:

- **`BotCommand` protocol** defines `triggers`, `description`, and `execute(message:)`.
- **`SongCommand`** handles `!song`, `!currentsong`, and `!nowplaying` and calls the injected `getCurrentSongInfo` closure.
- **`BotCommandDispatcher`** wires commands together and is used inside `TwitchChatService`.

**Code Organization:**

- Each command file is fully documented with usage examples
- Clear separation between command logic and service integration
- Type-safe message processing with optional return values

### Adding a New Command (example)

```swift
/// Command that greets users in chat.
///
/// Triggers: !hello, !hi
final class HelloCommand: BotCommand {
    let triggers = ["!hello", "!hi"]
    let description = "Greets the chatter"

    func execute(message: String) -> String? {
        let trimmed = message.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces).lowercased()

        for trigger in triggers {
            if trimmed.hasPrefix(trigger) {
                return "Hello, chat! 👋"
            }
        }

        return nil
    }
}
```

Register it in `BotCommandDispatcher.registerDefaultCommands()`:

```swift
private func registerDefaultCommands() {
    register(SongCommand())
    register(HelloCommand())  // Add your new command
}
```

Add a Settings toggle if you want user control over enabling/disabling the command.

### Security

- WebSocket tokens, Twitch OAuth tokens, and Twitch bot usernames are stored in Keychain
- Tokens are not written to UserDefaults or disk in plain text

### Added

- CI pipeline with Developer ID certificate import, code signing, notarization via `notarytool`, stapling, and keychain cleanup

### Changed

- **Channel Validation**: Moved Twitch channel name validation from keystroke-triggered to connect-button-triggered. No more API calls while typing — validation happens when you click Connect.
- **Bot Command Toggles**: Fixed bug where disabling a command toggle didn't persist across app restarts. Commands now read their enabled state from UserDefaults at initialization.
- **Command Aliases in Settings**: Bot command toggle rows now show all trigger aliases (e.g., `!song · !currentsong · !nowplaying`).
- **Onboarding Welcome Step**: Updated to list all features (Music Sync, Twitch Chat Bot, Discord Rich Presence, Stream Overlays, Menu Bar) with brand-colored icons.
- **Onboarding Window**: Now centers on screen before showing to prevent flash at origin.
- **Menu Bar Simplified**: Removed now-playing display from the tray icon menu. Menu now contains only Settings, About, and Quit.
- **macOS System Colors**: UI uses system accent colors and semantic colors for automatic light/dark mode support.
- **Discord Auto-Reconnect**: Exponential backoff reconnection (5s base, doubles to 60s cap) with availability polling when Discord is not running.
- **Twitch Reconnection**: Network path monitoring with automatic reconnection on connectivity changes, capped at 5 retry cycles with 60s cooldown.
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs for current features, added Legal section with Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- **UX Wording**: Unified feature naming (Music Sync, Now-Playing Widget), standardized empty states, shortened descriptions for ADHD-friendliness
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Established H1/H2/H3 heading system across all settings views
- **Thread Safety**: Fixed MainActor.assumeIsolated crash risks, added lock coverage for Twitch service properties
- **Sparkle Updates**: Completely disabled in DEBUG builds, fixed appcast Ed25519 signing
- **Dev Bundle**: Separate .dev bundle ID for side-by-side development testing

### Removed

- Now-playing track display from the menu bar dropdown (moved to Music Monitor settings preview).

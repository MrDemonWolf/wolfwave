# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Multi-source music support** — choose between Apple Music (direct ScriptingBridge connection) and Any App (System), which uses the macOS Now Playing API to capture playback from Spotify, browsers, and any other app. Setting lives in Music Monitor preferences.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Discord buttons** — Rich Presence now shows two clickable buttons: **Open in Apple Music** (direct track link) and **song.link** (opens on Spotify, YouTube Music, Tidal, and more). Buttons appear whenever a track link resolves, even if artwork isn't available.
- **Launch at Login** — new toggle in Settings → App Visibility. Uses `SMAppService` so it appears in System Settings → General → Login Items. Enabling it automatically switches "Dock Only" mode to "Dock and Menu Bar" so the app is always reachable.
- **Custom DMG background** — installer window now has a polished dark background with the WolfWave brand colors and a drag-to-Applications arrow.
- **Homebrew auto-update** — a GitHub Actions workflow now automatically opens a pull request on the Homebrew tap whenever a new release is published.

### Fixed

- iTunes Search API URL encoding — track and artist names containing `&`, `+`, or `=` no longer produce broken artwork/link lookups (switched to `URLComponents` + `URLQueryItem`).
- Launch at Login toggle now reverts if `SMAppService` registration fails, preventing a mismatch between the UI and actual system state.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- App icon missing in CI-built releases (added pre-built .icns fallback for Xcode 16 runners)
- Sparkle updater unable to detect new versions (build number now incremented per release)
- Sparkle initialization race condition (restored synchronous init instead of deferred async)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Dropped Intel (x86_64) support — Apple Silicon only
- Raised minimum macOS version to 26.0 (Tahoe)
- Logger: replaced NSLock with serial DispatchQueue for thread-safe file I/O
- TwitchChatService/DiscordRPCService: documented thread safety patterns
- KeychainService: added error logging for all Keychain operations
- AppConstants: cached GitHub repo resolution (no longer recomputes on every access)
- Migrated TwitchViewModel and OnboardingViewModel to @Observable macro
- WhatsNewView: dynamic version string, native button style, v1.0.1 feature highlights
- Narrowed entitlements file exception path
- Added Twitch user ID redaction to log output
- NotificationCenter observers now properly cleaned up on app termination
- Windows (Settings, Onboarding, What's New) properly released on close
- Deferred Sparkle/onboarding init past initial layout to fix layoutSubtreeIfNeeded warning
- Removed duplicate "up to date" alert (Sparkle handles it natively)
- Added VoiceOver accessibility labels across all settings and onboarding views

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Native macOS menu bar app for Apple Music integration
- Real-time now-playing detection via ScriptingBridge and distributed notifications with 2-second fallback polling
- Twitch chat bot with `!song`, `!currentsong`, `!nowplaying`, `!lastsong`, `!last`, `!prevsong` commands
- Discord Rich Presence showing "Listening to Apple Music" with dynamic album art
- OBS stream widget via built-in WebSocket server (browser source overlay)
- Automatic updates via Sparkle for DMG installs; Homebrew Cask installs are updated separately via `brew upgrade --cask wolfwave`
- First-launch onboarding wizard (Welcome, Twitch, Discord, OBS Widget)
- macOS Keychain credential storage (no plain-text tokens)
- Twitch OAuth Device Code authentication flow
- Bot command cooldowns (global + per-user, default 15s) and broadcaster bypass
- Channel validation with Twitch Helix API
- Settings UI with NavigationSplitView sidebar (Music Monitor, App Visibility, Twitch, Discord, OBS Widget, Advanced)
- Unified Music Monitoring panel with integration status indicators
- App visibility modes: menu bar only, dock only, or both
- Diagnostic log export
- Full reset / danger zone in Advanced settings
- CI pipeline with Developer ID certificate import, code signing, notarization via `notarytool`, stapling, and keychain cleanup

### Changed

- **Channel Validation**: Moved Twitch channel name validation from keystroke-triggered to connect-button-triggered. No more API calls while typing — validation happens when you click Connect.
- **Bot Command Toggles**: Fixed bug where disabling a command toggle didn't persist across app restarts. Commands now read their enabled state from UserDefaults at initialization.
- **Command Aliases in Settings**: Bot command toggle rows now show all trigger aliases (e.g., `!song · !currentsong · !nowplaying`).
- **Onboarding Welcome Step**: Updated to list all features (Music Sync, Twitch Chat Bot, Discord Rich Presence, Stream Overlays, Menu Bar) with brand-colored icons.
- **Onboarding Window**: Now centers on screen before showing to prevent flash at origin.
- **Menu Bar Simplified**: Removed now-playing display from the tray icon menu. Menu now contains only Settings, About, and Quit.
- **macOS System Colors**: UI uses system accent colors and semantic colors for automatic light/dark mode support.
- **Discord Auto-Reconnect**: Exponential backoff reconnection (5s base, doubles to 60s cap) with availability polling when Discord is not running.
- **Twitch Reconnection**: Network path monitoring with automatic reconnection on connectivity changes, capped at 5 retry cycles with 60s cooldown.
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs for current features, added Legal section with Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- **UX Wording**: Unified feature naming (Music Sync, Now-Playing Widget), standardized empty states, shortened descriptions for ADHD-friendliness
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Established H1/H2/H3 heading system across all settings views
- **Thread Safety**: Fixed MainActor.assumeIsolated crash risks, added lock coverage for Twitch service properties
- **Sparkle Updates**: Completely disabled in DEBUG builds, fixed appcast Ed25519 signing
- **Dev Bundle**: Separate .dev bundle ID for side-by-side development testing

### Removed

- Now-playing track display from the menu bar dropdown (moved to Music Monitor settings preview).

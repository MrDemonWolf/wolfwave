description: How to build and configure WolfWave for development
---

This guide is for developers who want to build WolfWave from source. If you just want to use WolfWave, see the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 15.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrDemonWolf/WolfWave.git
cd WolfWave
```

## Configure API Keys

Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig.example src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig
```

Open `src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig` and set your keys:

```
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID = your_twitch_client_id_here
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID = your_discord_client_id_here
```

<Callout type="info">
  Get a Twitch Client ID at
  [dev.twitch.tv/console/apps](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). Get a Discord
  Application ID at
  [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  `Config.xcconfig` is gitignored — each contributor uses their own.
</Callout>

## Open the Project

```bash
make open-xcode
# or
open src/wolfwave.xcodeproj
```

## Build and Run

Build and run from Xcode using ⌘R.

## Production Build

For a release build with DMG output:

```bash
make prod-build
```

The DMG will be created at `builds/WolfWave-{version}-arm64.dmg`. If a Developer ID Application certificate is found in your Keychain, the app will be re-signed for distribution automatically.

To build and install directly to `/Applications`:

```bash
make prod-install
```

## Notarization

After building the DMG, notarize it for Gatekeeper-trusted distribution:

```bash
APPLE_ID=you@example.com \
APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID \
APPLE_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
make notarize
```

<Callout type="info">
  Generate an app-specific password at
  [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage) under **Sign-In and
  Security → App-Specific Passwords**.
</Callout>

## CI/CD

Pushing a version tag triggers the GitHub Actions workflow which automatically builds, notarizes, and creates a GitHub Release:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

See the [Development Guide](/docs/development) for required GitHub secrets.

description: How to use WolfWave
---

WolfWave is user-friendly and runs from your macOS menu bar. Here's a guide to the features:

## Menu Bar

The WolfWave icon appears in your macOS menu bar and shows your current track information.

## Features

### Apple Music Tracking

Toggle Apple Music tracking on/off from the menu. When enabled, WolfWave monitors your currently playing track in real-time using ScriptingBridge.

### WebSocket Streaming

Configure WebSocket streaming to broadcast now-playing data to your overlays or other tools:

- Set your WebSocket endpoint (ws:// or wss://)
- Optionally configure JWT authentication
- Data updates automatically when the track changes

### Twitch Bot Integration

Connect your Twitch bot via secure device code authentication:

1. Open the Twitch settings
2. Click "Connect" to start the device auth flow
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize
4. Your bot will automatically connect to your channel

### Discord Rich Presence

Show what you're listening to on your Discord profile — just like Spotify, but for Apple Music.

#### Setup

1. Create a Discord application at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Copy the **Application ID**
3. (Optional) Upload an Apple Music logo as a Rich Presence asset named `apple_music`
4. Add the Application ID to your `Config.xcconfig` as `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
5. Enable Discord Rich Presence in **Settings → Discord**

#### What It Shows

When a song is playing, your Discord profile will display:

- **"Listening to Apple Music"** activity status
- **Song title** and **artist name**
- **Album name**
- **Album artwork** (fetched automatically from the iTunes Search API)
- **Playback progress** with elapsed time and duration

<Callout type="info">
  Album artwork is fetched dynamically — no need to manually upload art assets to Discord.
  If you upload an `apple_music` asset to your Discord app, it will appear as a small icon
  alongside the album art.
</Callout>

#### Requirements

- Discord must be running on your Mac
- WolfWave connects automatically via Discord's local IPC socket
- No bot token or server setup required

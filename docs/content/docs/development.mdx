This guide covers everything you need to contribute to WolfWave.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 15.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Copy `src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig.example` to `src/wolfwave/Config.xcconfig`
3. Set your Twitch Client ID and Discord Client ID in `Config.xcconfig`
4. Open the project: `make open-xcode`
5. Resolve dependencies: `make update-deps`

## Development Commands

| Command            | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `make build`       | Debug build                              |
| `make clean`       | Clean build artifacts                    |
| `make test`        | Run tests (if configured)                |
| `make update-deps` | Resolve SwiftPM dependencies             |
| `make open-xcode`  | Open the Xcode project                   |
| `make ci`          | CI-friendly build                        |
| `make prod-build`  | Release build + DMG in `builds/`         |
| `make prod-install`| Release build + install to `/Applications`|
| `make notarize`    | Notarize the DMG (requires Developer ID) |

## Code Quality

This project follows Swift best practices with professional-grade documentation:

- **Swift 5.9+** with modern concurrency (async/await)
- **SwiftUI** for user interfaces
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: DocC-style comments throughout with usage examples
- **MARK Sections**: All files organized with clear section markers for easy navigation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean architecture across Core/Services/Views/Monitors
- **Secure Credential Storage**: macOS Keychain for all sensitive data
- **ScriptingBridge Integration**: Direct Apple Music communication without spawning subprocesses
- **Robust Error Handling**: Typed errors with localized descriptions
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed models for all data structures
- **Zero Dependencies**: All functionality uses native Apple frameworks

## Twitch Chat Service

The bot is implemented with `TwitchChatService` using Twitch Helix + EventSub (no IRC).

### Features

- **EventSub WebSocket**: Real-time chat message notifications
- **OAuth Device Code Flow**: Secure authentication via `TwitchDeviceAuth`
- **Token Validation**: Automatic token validation on app launch
- **Command System**: Extensible bot command architecture

### Usage

- Connect with saved credentials: `joinChannel(broadcasterID:botID:token:clientID:)` or `connectToChannel(channelName:token:clientID:)`
- Send chat messages via Helix: `sendMessage(_:)` or `sendMessage(_:replyTo:)`
- Supply current track info for commands: set `getCurrentSongInfo` on the service
- Commands can be toggled in Settings ("Bot Commands" → "Current Song")
- The service respects `commandsEnabled` so you can disable all commands from Settings

### Documentation

- Comprehensive MARK sections organize the 700+ line service file
- DocC-style comments document all public methods
- Typed errors with localized descriptions (`ConnectionError`)
- Models for chat messages, badges, and replies

## Discord Rich Presence Service

`DiscordRPCService` communicates with Discord via the local IPC Unix domain socket.

### Features

- **IPC Socket Client**: Connects to Discord's local Unix domain socket (`discord-ipc-{0..9}`)
- **Dynamic Artwork**: Fetches album art from the iTunes Search API with caching
- **Auto-reconnect**: Automatic reconnection with backoff when Discord restarts
- **Sandbox Compatible**: Works within the macOS App Sandbox via SBPL entitlements

### Usage

- Start the service: `connect()` — discovers and connects to Discord's IPC socket
- Update presence: `updatePresence(track:artist:album:duration:elapsed:)` — sets the listening activity
- Clear presence: `clearPresence()` — removes the activity from the user's profile
- The service is wired into the music playback delegate in `WolfWaveApp.swift`

## CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that automates the release process.

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret                       | Description                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12`     | Base64-encoded Developer ID .p12     |
| `DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD`| Password for the .p12 file           |
| `APPLE_ID`                  | Apple ID email for notarization      |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`             | Developer Team ID                    |
| `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`        | App-specific password                |
| `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`          | Twitch application Client ID        |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`         | Discord application ID               |

### Triggering a Release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will build, sign, notarize, and create a GitHub Release with the DMG attached.

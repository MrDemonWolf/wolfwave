WolfWave is packed with features to connect your Apple Music with your streaming audience.

## Music Integration

### Real-time Now Playing

- **Last Played Tracking**: Keep history of your recently played songs

### Music Monitor Controls

## Twitch Integration

### Modern API Implementation

- **Helix API**: Full integration with Twitch's current API (no deprecated IRC)
- **OAuth Device Code Flow**: Secure authentication without entering credentials in the app

### Chat Commands

Built-in commands for your viewers:

| Command        | Description              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `!song`        | Current playing song     |

### Bot Features

- **Command Toggles**: Enable/disable individual commands from settings

## Discord Rich Presence

### Listening Status

Show what you're listening to directly on your Discord profile — just like Spotify, but for Apple Music.

- **"Listening to Apple Music"**: Activity type 2 displays a listening status on your profile
- **Dynamic Album Artwork**: Album art is fetched automatically from the iTunes Search API — no manual setup needed
- **Track Details**: Displays artist, song title, and album name
- **Playback Progress**: Shows elapsed time and track duration
- **Auto-connect**: Connects to Discord automatically when the app launches
- **Auto-reconnect**: Reconnects when Discord restarts or becomes available

### How It Works

WolfWave communicates with Discord via the local IPC socket — no bot token or server required. You only need a Discord Application ID from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## WebSocket Streaming

### Overlay Integration

- **Real-time Data**: Broadcast now-playing data to your stream overlays
- **Protocol Support**: Works with ws:// and wss:// endpoints
- **JWT Authentication**: Optional token-based authentication for secure connections

### Data Format

Song data is broadcast in a structured format for easy integration with your overlay tools.

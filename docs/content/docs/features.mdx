## Discord Rich Presence

### Listening Status

Show what you're listening to directly on your Discord profile — just like Spotify, but for Apple Music.

- **Auto-connect**: Connects to Discord automatically when the app launches
- **Auto-reconnect**: Reconnects when Discord restarts or becomes available

### How It Works

WolfWave communicates with Discord via the local IPC socket — no bot token or server required. You only need a Discord Application ID from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## WebSocket Streaming

### Overlay Integration

- **Protocol Support**: Works with ws:// and wss:// endpoints

### Data Format

Song data is broadcast in a structured format for easy integration with your overlay tools.

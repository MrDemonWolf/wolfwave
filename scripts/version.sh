# version.sh — single source of truth for marketing version + build number.
#
# Implements the house build/version standard documented in
# docs/build-versioning-standard.md. Every platform job in every pipeline calls
# this once and consumes the result; nothing downstream invents its own number.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/version.sh                       # stable channel, JSON
#   scripts/version.sh --channel nightly     # nightly channel, JSON
#   scripts/version.sh --format env          # KEY=value, for `eval` or $GITHUB_OUTPUT
#
# Output keys: marketing, build, short_sha, channel
#

# Build-number floor.
#
# The build number is the commit count, which only ever needs a floor when a
# repo has already published a build number above its own commit count. Raising
# this is a one-way door: it can only ever go up, never down, because Sparkle
# and both app stores reject a build number that regresses.
#
# WolfWave note: the retired nightly scheme published build 202608051034 (a UTC
# minute stamp). That value is ~100x over Android's 2,100,000,000 versionCode
# cap and can never be part of this standard, so it was deliberately abandoned
# rather than floored past. Nightly is opt-in and unsupported; testers running
# that one build reinstall the DMG once. Stable's published build was 8, which
# the commit count clears on its own.

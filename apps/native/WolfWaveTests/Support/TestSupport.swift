/// for XCTest-based suites, which auto-cleans on tearDown.

/// Round-trips a credential through a save/load/delete cycle and asserts the

/// closures bound to the specific KeychainService API under test.

/// - Parameters:
///   - value: Value to round-trip. Must not be empty.

///   - load: Load closure returning the persisted value or nil.
///   - delete: Delete closure.
///   - sourceLocation: Forwarded so Swift Testing reports the caller's line.

// MARK: - WebSocket Server Service

/// Broadcasts now-playing data to stream overlay clients over a local WebSocket connection.
///
/// Built on `NWListener` (Network.framework). Overlay clients such as OBS browser sources
/// connect and receive JSON messages for track changes, progress ticks, and playback state.
/// State is actor-confined; a small snapshot is exposed for synchronous `nonisolated` reads
/// from SwiftUI views, and a `stateChanges` `AsyncStream` replaces the legacy callback.
///
/// ## Security model
///
/// - The listener binds to all interfaces so LAN peers (a second-PC OBS, a phone
///   browser) can reach the widget. Two-PC setups would otherwise be impossible.
/// - Overlay clients authenticate with a read-only `wolfwave.overlay.<hex>`
///   subprotocol. They receive state broadcasts but cannot execute commands.
/// - Stream Deck authenticates with a separate `wolfwave.control.<hex>`
///   subprotocol. Control-role connections are accepted only from a literal
///   loopback IP, and only that role can execute commands.
/// - Local widgets get the overlay token for free: `WidgetHTTPService` injects it into
///   the served `widget.html` only for a loopback TCP peer with a literal-local
///   Host header, so same-Mac OBS Browser Sources "just work" without exposing
///   the credential to DNS-rebinding requests. Remote browsers use `?token=…`
///   as bootstrap for the WebSocket subprotocol.
/// - Connections without a valid role-specific subprotocol are rejected before
///   they can receive playback frames.
/// - Rotating either credential restarts the listener so authorized clients are dropped.
/// - The initializer that omits credentials exists for lifecycle tests and
///   grants only the read-only overlay role.

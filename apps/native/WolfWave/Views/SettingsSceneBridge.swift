/// Invisible bridge that lets AppKit entry points (the status-bar menu, Dock
/// context menu, Dock reopen, and Twitch re-auth) open the SwiftUI `Settings`
/// scene through the public `@Environment(\.openSettings)` action instead of the
/// private `showSettingsWindow:` selector, which logs "Please use SettingsLink
/// for opening the Settings scene" on macOS 14+.
///
/// `openSettings` only resolves to the real scene-open action when read inside a
/// *live* SwiftUI render tree connected to the App scene graph. A detached
/// `NSHostingView` does not qualify on macOS 26, which is why the previous
/// offscreen-host approach (probing a hidden `SettingsLink` for a clickable
/// control) fell back to the private selector and logged the warning.
///
/// So this view is hosted in a real (but hidden) `Window` scene declared in
/// `WolfWaveApp.body` *before* the `Settings` scene, and is driven by
/// `AppDelegate.openSettings()` via the `.openSettingsRequested` notification.
/// `BridgeWindowNeutralizer` keeps that host window offscreen and invisible so it
/// never appears and never trips `applyDockVisibility`'s visible-normal-key probe.

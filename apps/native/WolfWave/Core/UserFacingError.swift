import Foundation

/// A failure described the way a streamer needs to hear it: what broke, why,
/// what to do, and a button that does it.
///
/// Every user-visible failure resolves to one of these. Services map their own
/// error types into it next to the type itself, so the structure survives the
/// trip to the UI instead of being flattened into a `String` at the view-model
/// seam. That flattening is what produced "Couldn't check channel" for four
/// unrelated causes, with the real reason reachable only through a tooltip.
///
/// This generalizes ``PlaylistSetupStatus``, which already proved the shape
/// works here by carrying its own message, action label, and severity.
///
/// Deliberately free of SwiftUI: ``Severity`` is semantic, and the view layer
/// owns the mapping to a tint. That keeps the model `Sendable`, testable
/// without a renderer, and usable from an actor.
///
/// ## Where these appear
///
/// macOS reserves modal alerts for things the user cannot proceed without
/// answering. A failed background reconnect is not that. So:
///
/// - **Inline** (``ErrorCallout``) for ambient state: a connection dropped, a
///   permission is off, a server won't start. The pane keeps working around it.
/// - **Alert** only when the user just asked for something and it failed
///   outright, so the answer belongs to the action they took: an import, an
///   export, a reset. The app has three of these today and should not grow many
///   more.
/// - **Under the field** (``FieldValidationRow``) when the failure is about
///   what was typed.
///
/// ```swift
/// UserFacingError(
///     id: "twitch.signInExpired",
///     title: "Twitch sign-in expired",
///     cause: "Twitch rejected the saved sign-in.",
///     fix: "Reconnect and WolfWave picks up where it left off.",
///     severity: .warning,
///     actions: [.reconnectTwitch]
/// )

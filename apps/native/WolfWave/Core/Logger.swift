///
/// This is the sole entry point on purpose. When `Log` also accepted a free-form
/// `String`, the enum went completely unused (0 call sites) and the exact typo it
/// existed to prevent shipped anyway: `"Reset"` was written at three sites and was
/// not a case, so those lines filtered as their own phantom category forever.
///
/// The raw value is what appears in the log file's category column and in
/// Console.app's Category field. Keep raw values at 12 characters or fewer so the
/// column stays aligned (see `Log.categoryWidth`).

/// ```
///
/// Fields, left to right: timestamp, level (padded), category (padded),
/// `File.swift:line` (padded), message, then an optional ` key=value` tail
/// from ``log(_:level:category:fields:file:line:)``. Fields are separated by
/// two or more spaces, so a parser can split on that run and take the message
/// as the remainder. ``LogRecord`` is the canonical reader; the grammar is
/// written up in `apps/native/docs/logging-format.md`.
///
/// Debug logs are only emitted in development builds (`DEBUG` flag).
/// Production builds only emit info, warning, and error logs.
///
/// Logs go to both the macOS unified logging system and a rotating file in the
/// app's Application Support directory. Use ``exportLogFile()`` for the URL.
///
/// ## Thread safety
///
/// All mutable file state (`fileHandle`, `_logFileURL`, `bannerPending`,
/// `lineCountCache`) is accessed exclusively on `fileQueue`, a serial dispatch
/// queue. The throttle table and the OSLog cache have their own locks.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// Log.info("Connected", category: .twitchChat)
/// Log.error("Reconnect failed", category: .twitchEvents, fields: ["attempt": 3, "code": 4003])
/// Log.debug("Payload dump", category: .dev)  // Only in development

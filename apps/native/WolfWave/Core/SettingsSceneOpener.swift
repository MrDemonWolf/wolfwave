/// menu and Dock reopen) through `SettingsLink`'s public action path instead of
/// the private `showSettingsWindow:` selector.
///
/// macOS 14+ logs "Please use SettingsLink for opening the Settings scene" when
/// the private selector is used. `SettingsLink` is a SwiftUI view and an `NSMenu`
/// cannot host one, so this keeps a tiny offscreen window whose content view is a
/// `SettingsLink` and clicks its realized control to run SwiftUI's own scene-open
/// action.
///
/// If SwiftUI does not expose a clickable control in the hosting view (its
/// internals vary by OS release), it falls back to the selector so Settings still
/// opens. The fallback is the only path that can still log the warning.
